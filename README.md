![Photo](left.png)

This repo is a _fork of a_ re-implementation of the [Dactyl Manuform Tight](https://github.com/okke-formsma/dactyl-manuform-tight) in python, with [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd)-like layout and Kailh Choc v1 spacing.


## Generating OpenSCAD Models

This script is tested against Python 3.8.0

Intall dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run a one-off scad model build with `make run`

Watch and rebuild scad models with `make watch` (useful for development)
